                            Bangladesh, economy "going in positive direction".</b></p>
                    <p> Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday said Pakistan's economic indicators had improved
                        compared to other countries despite the Covid-19 pandemic, adding that the country's exports
                        had shown an increase higher than that of its regional competitors.</p>

                    <p> The prime minister was speaking at a ceremony in Islamabad celebrating the milestone of the
                        Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) initiative crossing the $500 million mark in remittances. He
                        has previously commented on this milestone in statement on Twitter.</p>

                    <p><i>“I want to thank our Overseas Pakistanis for responding so strongly to SBP’s
                            #RoshanDigitalAccounts. 87,833 accounts opened from 97 countries around the world. $500
                            million sent to Pakistan in just 5 months. Momentum continues to rise with $243 million
                            coming in last 6 weeks alone,” PM Khan tweeted on Tuesday.</i></p>

                    <p>The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) confirmed that due to a fault in an
                        international submarine cable system near Abu Talat, Egypt, users faced some degradation in
                        internet
                        services.</p>

                    <p>The disruptions developed at the SMW-5 due to subsea fault in the cable system, operated by the
                        Trans World Associates (TWA).</p>

                    <p> The TWA communicated about the service degradation in international connectivity towards Europe
                        and
                        said that repair work was underway through international counterparts in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The TWA systems cater for around 40 per cent of internet traffic in Pakistan and the company
                        executive acknowledged that the internet users across the country will experience downgraded
                        speeds
                        until the users are shifted expectedly by late Wednesday night.</p>

                    <p> The fault has occurred in the cable system coming from France and the TWA executive said ISPs
                        were
                        in the process of shifting the load to other submarine systems coming from Singapore.</p>

                    <p> Most of the internet outages have occurred in the country due to faults in undersea cables.</p>

                            elections, Justice Ijazul Ahsan on Wednesday told the body that the vote in Senate polls
                            "cannot remain secret forever".</b></p>

                    <p>During the hearing on Tuesday, the five-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice Gulzar
                        Ahmed, had asked Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikander Sultan Raja to consider
                        recommendations
                        presented by Attorney General of Pakistan Khalid Jawed Khan and submit a response to the court.
                    </p>

                    <p>In its response submitted to the court today, the ECP maintained that according to Article 226 of
                        the Constitution, Senate elections could be held through secret voting only.</p>

                    <p> The ECP's counsel said that votes for the Senate elections would "always remain secret" and the
                        votes that were cast could "not be shown to anyone".</p>

                    <p><b>KARACHI:</b> Lahore Qalandars, arguably the most favourite HBL Pakistan Super League franchise
                        for the cricketing masses, had to suffer four years of heartbreak on the trot since the start of
                        the
                        T20 extravaganza as each season they were plummeted in the last place.</p>

                    <p>However, the year 2020 changed everything for the beleaguered Qalandars who not just qualified
                        for
                        the playoffs but also managed to go all the way to the final where they misread the pitch
                        conditions
                        at the National Stadium and lost after the Covid-19 pandemic cruelly denied them the opportunity
                        of
                        playing the decider in their hometown, Lahore.</p>

                    <p> Despite that setback, Qalandars were not disgraced since it was a massive turnaround for the
                        franchise, which is owned by Fawad Rana, who is a very popular figure and had been through
                        countless
                        periods of tribulations and ecstasy all these years.</p>

                    <p>There is no denying that Lahore Qalandars will be one of the top contenders for the HBL PSL 6
                        title
                        and would surely love to make the playoffs — and of course, the final — for the second straight
                        season and perhaps bask themselves in the ultimate glory in front of ardent supporters at the
                        Gaddafi Stadium on March 22.</p>
